###Audio and Music Signals

###What is a Signal?
The term *signal* has many connotations, however in the case of digital audio and musical signals, we can designate the term *signal* to mean...<br>
*information carrying inputs and outputs of processes in a system*
###What is a Wave?
A wave is an abstraction of what is happen on the physical level when sound travels. The movement of a sound compresses and rarefacts the given medium it travels. This motion is described as a function of time. We can plot this motion across a graph which gives us a representation of what is happening at the physical level. This representation is referred to as a **wave**. Different waves are the results of different audio phenomenon, and produce different shapes when graphed. We call these different shapes/forms, **waveforms**.

#Musical Signals
---
Musical Signals are a subcatagory of all signals in general. It is subjective of what signal would qualify as a musical one, however in the digital landscape, musical signals are characterized by their needs in fidelity, codeing/decoding, storage and playback.<br>
One thing that might constrain a signal to be a musical one, is its frequency range lying within that of human hearing (20hz - 20,000hz).
###Scales
In order to manipulate musical signals, we need a means of organizing their pitch. The most conventional way to do this is based on the notion of **scales**.<br>
The relationship of two musical signals are perceived not in a linear way, but by the *ratios* between the two frequencies. Because of this, we must define the relationship of our frequencies on a logarithmic system.
