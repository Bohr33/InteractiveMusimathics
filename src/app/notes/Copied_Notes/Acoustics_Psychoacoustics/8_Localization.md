#Localization

###Dimensions of Human Head
- Head is Assumed Spherical

Average Circumference is 56 cm.
- Males = 57cm
- Females = 55cm


###Sound localisation
Loclalising sounds depends on how we perceive the differences in time and level between the two ears. 


##Inter-Channel Level Difference ILD
This is the mechanism wherby we locate sounds based on a difference in level received at each ear.

###ILD Panning
This shows how a difference between levels in each ear will equate to our perceived location. A differnence of about 12 dB means we completely hear it from one side. 6dB is half-way between both. +3 dB equates to aaout quarter shift in panning field.


##Diffraction
Essentially a waves ability to "bend" around an object. When a wave encounters a slit, it will "bend" to fill the entire area and become a uniform semi-circle eminating from the slit.

Sound will diffract around barriers, pillars, and around our heads, when the wavelength is equal to or greater than the width of ht ebarrier. Higher frequencies will simply reflect off, or be basorbed by the barrier.

###Head Shadowing
This is the phenomonon where high frequencies are unable to diffract around the head, this leads a gap in high frequencies in the opposite direction the source sound is coming from.

###Pinnae Shadowing
When the back of the ears. (pinnae) creates a shadowing effect.


###Interaural Timing Difference - ITD
The distance between ears is small, however this difference has a significant effect on how we perceive timing differences between the sounds.

###ITD vs ILD
ITD is preferred as a method of localisation for low frequencies, and ILD is preferred as a method of localisation of high frequencies.

These methods crossover in frequency range 700Hz to 2.8 kHz.
