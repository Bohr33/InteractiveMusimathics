#Project Proposal

For my final project in interactive systems, I intended to create an improvisational performance system using a combination of hardware and software equipment. I will use the modular and semi-modular synthesizers in the lab as well as digital MIDI controllers to create elements of an electronic piece that will be controlled in real-time.

Most, if not all of the sounds will be designed and produced through the modular equipment. A combination of MIDI controllers and possibly custom software will be used to control different parameters of the sound the modular equipment is generating. Certain aspects will be somewhat generative.

The system will use, but may not be limited to the following devices...

- **Laptop**: Running Ableton Live and outputing pre-defined MIDI clips as well as a clock signal for the rest of the system.
- **Ableton Push**: This will act as a controller to control certain MIDI messages that will be sent to the system through out the performance. 
- **MIDI/CV converter** - converts messages from live to clock signal, as well as further MIDI2CV output.
- **ARP2500 Modular, System 55**: primary modular sound generates, will create sequences and process sounds with filter modules, amplitude modules, etc.
- **Artura Keylab Pro/Seaboard**: will act as a keybed to improvise 1 or more synthesizers with. Currently using the keylab, however may replace with the ROLI seaboard at somepoint.
- **Pro-800**: Will serve as another synthesizer element which will receive MIDI clips as controlled by Ableton Push.
