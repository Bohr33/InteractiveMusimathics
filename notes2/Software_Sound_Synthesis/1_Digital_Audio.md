Sound is simply the physical disturbance of a medium. At the lowest level, the disturbances are caused by the interaction of molecules compressing and retracting. When these compressions are consitent, or **periodic**, they create the sensation of pitch.

##Elements of a Sound Wave
- **Frequency** - Number of cycles per second
- **Wavelength** - the distance it takes to complete a single cycle
- **Period** - The amount of time it takes to repeat a single cycle

###Period/Frequency Relationship
*Period and Frequency are inverses of eachother*

`Frequency = 1/Period`
`Period = 1/Frequency`<br><br>
If we know the frequency of a sound, and how fast its going (speed of sound), we can calculate the wavelength simply by...<br>
`Wavelength = Velocity/Frequency`
###Amplitude & Phase
**Phase** - the starting point of a waveform. This is given in terms of degrees and represents the angle of the cycle.<br>
**Amplitude** - The highest level of a given sound wave. Is measured from 0 to the highest point on the y-axis of the cycle.
