#SuperSaw
---
 Produces arpeggiating harmonics due to small differences in phase. <br>


###Operating Principle
1. The sawtooth wave has many harmonics each with a relative amplitude defined by the reciprocal o fthe harmonic number (1/n).
2. If we tune the oscillators so that they have clse but not the exact same frequencies, and mix them together, the result will be that the harmonics will add and subtract together at different times due to them getting in and out of phase with each other.


*The detuning of the oscillators creates the wide and larger effect.* <br>
###Notes on Effects
1. The more detuning you have (greater variance between center frequency) The fast the resulting filtering "beat" will be.


##Questions
1. What happens if we use different waveforms while keep the same effect?
