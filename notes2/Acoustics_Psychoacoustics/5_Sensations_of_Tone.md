#Hamonic Series and Analysis

###Analysis Applications

Spear - Take a look at the spear software. It allows you to listen to the individual harmonics of a given sound. You can go in and select specific frequency bands and do stuff.

Sonic Visualizer - another analysis tool. I don't know if its better or worse than spear but check it out.


##Hamonic Series

1/1, 2/3, 1/3 etc, you get it.<br>
