#Instrument Acoustics

##Types of Instruments
###Chordophone
###Aeropphone
Sound prodcued based on the vibration of air waves
###Idiophone
###Membranophone
Based on the vibratoin of a surface under tension
###Electrophone
Sound produced or amplified by electronic means

##Aerophones

###Pipe open at both ends
Th wave length of sound produced by a pipe in an aerophone is determined by 2 times the length of the pipe.

Pipe Diameter is not significant in determining the fundamental frequency of a resonating pipe.

Pipe diameter is directly proportional to output amplitude, but a higher injection of energy is reequired

###Air Jets
Air jets are what is used to produced to a sound with a pipe at both ends. The air jet is split across one open end to produce the standing wave.


###Harmonics
By overblowing, increasing the frequency of the air jet, a higher order standing wave can be produced in which only the even hormonics of the original waves can be produced.

###Pipe Closed at one end
The closed end enforces a pressure node at the barrier. Now, the funamental will be 4 times the length of the pipe. Only odd nubered harmonics are produced.


###Closed Pipe as a filter
A closed pipe can be used as a filtering/resonating attachment

Pipe filters are used in instruments like vibraphones and xylophones and marimbas.


###Conical Bores
Conical bores (like that of a trumpet and french horn) will tned to suppress higher harmonics quicker. This why french horns have a much more mellow sound compared to the trumpet.

###Helmholtz Resonator
Helmholtz resonator is special type of resonator where a small opening grows into a much larger spherical container. This will resonate with an excitation of the resonators fundamental frequency.

Hemlholtz resonators are also used in studios to eat up the annoying resonanting frequencies that appear in studios.
